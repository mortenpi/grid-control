3. Use md5 hash to verify transfer between node <-> se
4. Statistic of done, failed, cancelled not only in total but optionally also per ce
   including failed and resubmitted jobs (good for blacklisting ...)   
5. FIX whitelisting

9. Local disk usage monitoring
10.Multiple datasets

X. FIX continous mode (-ic) (welches Problem)
	(fixed?)
X. enable condidtions for job failure (e.g. root-file <1 MB...)
	([storage]: se min size)
X. add timestamp to storage-out-files
	([storage]: se output pattern)
X. decuple CMSSW-version and grid-requirements. - Die nasen vergessen immer die TAGS...

X. Possibility to use job states in abbreviated form for the -d deletion command.
   E.g. use first letter up to point where unique in list of all job states. (-d W,RE,Q)
	(-d R == READY,RUNNING; -d RE == READY; -d R,Q == READY,RUNNING,QUEUED; ...)
