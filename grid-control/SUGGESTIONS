1. Show location in job-status/ ev. have information output
2. Possibility to give time limit after which jobs in WAITING, READY or QUEUED state
   are automatically cancelled (and then resubmitted in case of -c option).
3. Use md5 hash to verify transfer between node <-> se
4. Statistic of done, failed, cancelled not only in total but optionally also per ce
   including failed and resubmitted jobs (good for blacklisting ...)   
5. FIX whitelisting
6. Multiple datasets
7. Option to "dont retry" - retry count
8. Local disk usage monitoring

X. FIX continous mode (-ic) (welches Problem)
	(fixed?)
X. enable conditions for job failure (e.g. root-file <1 MB...)
	([storage]: se min size)
X. add timestamp to storage-out-files
	([storage]: se output pattern)
X. decuple CMSSW-version and grid-requirements. - Die nasen vergessen immer die TAGS...
	([CMSSW]: use requirements)
X. Possibility to use job states in abbreviated form for the -d deletion command.
   E.g. use first letter up to point where unique in list of all job states. (-d W,RE,Q)
	(-d R == READY,RUNNING; -d RE == READY; -d R,Q == READY,RUNNING,QUEUED; ...)
X. Or: Shorthand for -d deletion of all jobs in WAITING READY or QUEUED state.
	(-d TODO, -d ALL)
X. Update job status on dashboard
	(done)
X. Random seed as command line argument
	(-S 1234,423,7856)
X. Local job finish signal (move files from se)
	([events]: on status, on submit, on output)
